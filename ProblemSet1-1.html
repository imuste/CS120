  <p>I wanted to take this class because I have at my previous school started 
    learning to do some HTML, CSS, and minimal Javascript coding, but the class
    didn't really go in much depth and I wanted to learn more and get more 
    experience doing these things. I have beginner/moderate experience with C++, 
    python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

  <h4>My 3 favorite foods are: </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Boeuf Bourguignon</li>
    <li>Kroketten</li>
    <li>Matar Paneer</li>
  </ul>

  <br/>

  <p>My favorite restaurant is Dali in Somerville because it has many small 
    dishes that you can share so you can eat a lot of different things. The 
    quality of their food is also really good.

  <p> I like to eat boeuf bourguignon with mashed potatoes and green beans on 
    the side. The reason I like this dish is because the meat when the dish is 
    made right melts immediately when you chew it. It is a very good winter meal
